# RiboKit Github Pages

<img src="assets/ribokit_logo.png" alt="RiboKit Logo" align="right" width="200px">

This is the repository that powers **https://ribokit.github.io** Github Pages. It uses the [ribokit/ribokit-Jekyll-theme](https://github.com/ribokit/ribokit-Jekyll-theme) and [ribokit/ribokit-Sphinx-theme](https://github.com/ribokit/ribokit-Sphinx-theme).

## Installation

For local test server setup, you need to install `jekyll`, simply:
```bash
gem install jekyll
```

* For system-wide installation, you must have permissions and use with `sudo`.

To run the test/dev server, use:
```bash
jekyll serve
```

To preview the server in your web browser, go to:

http://localhost:4000/

* If you run into an issue with 301 redirects, we haven't yet solved it. The quick hack: temporarily move the folder `redirect/` out of the repository; remember to bring it back into the repo before committing. 

## Contributing

Please follow the instructions at https://ribokit.github.io/docs/ for contributing new contents. Format standard for text and images, as well as integration of `jekyll` or `sphinx` pages are described in detail.
