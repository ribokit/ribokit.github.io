# Step 2: Further Alignment _<small>(optional)</small>_

<br/>

After [**Step #1**](../step_1/), small differences in mobilities in mutants are still apparent ("waviness"). For **2D** datasets, the shifts are actually due to differences in sequence between different lanes. We now are interested in fine-tuning this alignment. 

<hr/>

We need to describe which profiles to align to each other. **We should only let profiles that are of same nature to be aligned to each other.**{: style="color:#ff5c2b;"} For example, lanes of the same modifier (e.g. DMS), or lanes of similar chemistry (e.g. 1M7 and NMIA, both SHAPE).

> ddNTPs sequencing ladders **should not be aligned to** each other, or to modifer profiles, because they have strong bands in totally different places. 

```matlab
align_blocks = {1:8, 9:24, 25:40, 41:56, 57:58, 59:60, 61:62, 63:64};
d_align_before_more_alignment = d_align;
d_align_dp_fine = align_by_DP_fine(d_align_before_more_alignment, align_blocks);
```

> The numberings in `align_blocks` are based on column indices of `d_align`; not to be confused with `reorder` previously. Simply speaking, the `reorder` numbering of ABI sequencer files (**.ab1**) is no longer relevant after [**Step #1**](../step_1/)!

The above code specified 8 groups for finer alignment in `align_blocks`. It treats _nomod_, DMS, CMCT, SHAPE, ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, and ddGTP separately from each other. It also copies the `d_align` into `d_align_before_more_alignment` as a back-up, in case `align_by_DP_fine()` yields unsatisfactory results.

You'll see a figure window showing the result side by side. It is obvious that _after_ further alignment the "waviness" is minimized. The red lines are guidelines of alignment anchors. (In this case, due to multiple `align_blocks`, it is misplaced. Please ignore.) 

> It is important to check if the further alignment introduces artifacts. Look for bands that are shifted around too much and decide whether to accept it. You can get an idea on using all ddNTPs lanes as one `align_blocks` and examine the obvious artifacts of forcing bands to align to each other.

There are other commands, e.g. `align_by_DP()` and `align_by_DP_using_ref()`, that performs alignment refinement in a different flavor. You may want to try those as well. You can also further-align on top of the result of `align_by_DP_fine()`. Make sure to backup your `d_align`. 

> Input arguments for `align_by_DP()` and `align_by_DP_using_ref()` may differ from `align_by_DP_fine()`. Use `help()` to double check.

To accept your further alignment, run:

```matlab
d_align = d_align_dp_fine;
```

<hr/>

As an example of **2D** data analysis, it is the same as **1D** for this step.

```matlab
align_blocks = {[1:55, 57:72]};
d_align_before_more_alignment = d_align;
d_align_dp_fine = align_by_DP_fine(d_align_before_more_alignment, align_blocks);
d_align = d_align_dp_fine;
```

This alignes all lanes (except 56) in 1 block. Lane 56 has bad data, thus is excluded here.
