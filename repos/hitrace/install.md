# Installation

**HiTRACE** requires *MATLAB* version `>= R2011a`. 

> ~~Later versions of *MATLAB* are incompatible with codes that involves interactive interface handling.~~

> For *Mac OS X* users with version `>= 10.10`, you may need this [patch](https://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/1098655) to settle a *Java* exception.

To install **HiTRACE**, simply:

- From GitHub or [**RMDB**](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/tools/), download the zip or tar file of the repository and unpack; or 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hitrace/HiTRACE.git
```

- In *MATLAB*, go to "**Set Path**". Then "**Add with Subfolders**" of the target `path/to/HiTRACE/Scripts/`.
