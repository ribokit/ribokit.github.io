# Step 5: Peak Fitting

<br/>

Since we have done the hard work assigning where each band is, it is time to collapse the area of each peak into one intensity reading. To do so, we run it with one command:

```matlab
[area_peak, darea_peak] = fit_to_gaussians(d_align, xsel);
```

It takes the `d_align` traces and the band positions in `xsel`, and fits electrophoretic traces to sums of Gaussians. It produces a figure:

[![fit_to_gaussians Figure](/repos/hitrace/res/pfl_1D_fig_fit.png "fit_to_gaussians Figure"){: .full}](/repos/hitrace/res/pfl_1D_fig_fit.png)
{: .center}

You'll see the original data on the _left_, the fitted profiles in the _middle_, and residuals on the _right_. There is often a lot of noise (alternating black and white bars) at the top and bottom of the plot; the very large signals there are often saturated and not reproduced well by Gaussians. [That's OK, we'll ignore that data later.] 

> Most of the traces should be captured in the _middle_. Some minor leaks would fall to the _right_, and it is fine. The regions outside of our annotate region are not captured.

> Note that this fit does not try to optimize the Gaussian widths (its assumed to be 0.25 times the mean peak spacing) or the band positions. To do that more complex fit, you can use `do_the_fit()`. But **watch out** since this can lead to spurious fluctuations especially for nearly merged bands.

Once finished, the `fit_to_gaussians()` command returns the following variables:

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `area_peak` | _(S+1)xN double_ | Fitted peak intensities. |
| `darea_peak` | _(S+1)xN double_ | Error estimates for `area_peak`, based on uncertainties of peak locations. |

<hr/>

As an example of **2D** data analysis, the commands are the same as **1D** for this step.

```matlab
[area_peak, darea_peak] = fit_to_gaussians(d_align, xsel);
area_peak(:, 56) = 0;
darea_peak(:, 56) = 0;
```

We erase lane 56 since it was bad data. This is to prevent accidental interpretation.
