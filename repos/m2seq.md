# M2seq

**M2seq** is a set of *Python* and *MATLAB* scripts that extract mutate-and-map signals from Illumina next-generation sequencing data.

Features include:

- Separation of barcoded samples
- Alignment to reference sequences, and extraction of mutations
- Visualization of mutate-and-map signals in the resulting data
- Creation of RDATs that can be analyzed by tools in [Biers](/Biers/rnastructure/#rnastructure-M2seq).
