# MaP2D

**MaP2D** is a software package for deriving 2D chemical mapping data from high-dose mutational profiling (MaP) experiments.
In high-dose MaP experiments, RNAs are exposed to a high concentration of modifier (e.g. DMS), leading to multiple modifications per RNA.
These multiple modifications can be read out by mutational profiling (see Homan et al. reference below).
MaP2D analysis generates 2D datasets similar to mutate-and-map (M2) using high-dose MaP sequencing data analyzed by ShapeMapper.

## Installation

**MaP2D** can be downloaded for non-commercial use at the [**RMDB**](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/tools/). Commercial users, please [**contact us**](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/help/about/#contact).

Instructions for installing MaP2D and analyzing MaP data are provided in the README.md file in the package. The package also includes example high-dose MaP sequencing data.
