# <samp>MAPseeker</samp>

**MAPseeker** is a software package for analyzing chemical mapping data from next-gen sequencing experiments, such as Multiple Adduct Probing read out through deep Sequencing (**MAP-seq**) and Multiplexed â€¢OH Cleavage Analysis read out through deep Sequencing (**MOHCA-seq**).
It includes an executable for performing sequence alignment and reverse transcription stop counting, as well as MATLAB scripts for calculating chemical reactivities and outputting data to RDAT text format and Python scripts for optional pre-processing of RNA fasta files.

## Installation

**MAPseeker** can be downloaded for non-commercial use at the [**RMDB**](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/tools/). Commercial users, please [**contact us**](https://rmdb.stanford.edu/help/about/#contact).

Installation instructions and tutorials for analyzing MAP-seq and MOHCA-seq data are provided in the README.md file in the package. The package also includes example MAP-seq and MOHCA-seq data.
