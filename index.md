## About

**RiboKit** brings together RNA modeling & analysis packages that have been developed and are maintained by the Das Lab and collaborators since 2009. The focus is on **multidimensional chemical mapping** methods for RNA structure inference. This site is maintained at the Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine. Being an academic effort, it's not perfect. If you need help, or have suggestions that will help your research, please send an e-mail to _ribokit.info [at] gmail.com_{: style="color:#3399cc"}.
