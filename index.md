## About

**RiboKit** provides a global overview of RNA modeling & analysis packages that have been developed and are maintained by the Das Lab and collaborators since 2009. This site is maintained at the Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine. Being an academic effort, it's not perfect. If you need help, or have suggestions that will help your research, please send an e-mail to ribokit.info [at] gmail.com.
